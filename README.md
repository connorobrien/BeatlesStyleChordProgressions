# Using Markov Chains to Generate Chord Progressions in the Style of The Beatles

This repository contains a personal project for generating chord progressions in the style of The Beatles in Python. It originated as a project for my undergraduate Linear Algebra course at Colorado College in 2013. 

There are two main parts of this project, each of which are separated into their own Python file. 

The first file, called Chord_Scraping.py, uses dynamic web scraping to collect data about The Beatles's chord progressions from [HookTheory.com's Theory Tab](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/index). Theory Tab contains over 13,000 chord progressions in an interactive, difficult to web-scrape interface. The program scrapes all available chord progressions for an artist on Hook Theory and writes a csv file with the name, key, and chord progression for each song.

The second file, called Chord_Analysis.py, reads in a CSV file of chord progression data (like the one from Chord_Scraping.py) and analyzes it so it can generate chord progressions in a similar style. In its current state, this program analyzes the chord movements of The Beatles, keeping track of what movements they typically make. For example, if they're writing in the key of C major, and they just played an E minor chord, what chord would The Beatles typically choose next? The data shows they'll likely move to an A minor, D minor seventh, or G major chord.

This program keeps track of all potential chord movements of The Beatles in a ‘transition state matrix’, which in layperson’s terms is a table of numbers that can find the probability of a next chord given the current chord. This method allows for ‘chaining’ of chord predictions (i.e. Markov Chains), which allows it to generate full chord progressions from a single start chord. As its currently set up, Chord_Scraping.py will produce ten chord progressions in the style of The Beatles in both a major and minor key. I’ve included an existing CSV with the web-scraped chord progression data for The Beatles, named ‘the_beatles_chordprogressiondata.csv’.

<h3>Running This Program</h3>

To run this program, you must download Chord_Analysis.py and Chord_Scraping.py, and potentially 'the_beatles_chordprogressiondata.csv' if you'd like to save yourself the trouble of web-scraping the chord progression data.

The modules necessary to run these two files are common, many of which are default libraries. You'll need:

<ul>
<li>Beautiful Soup (bs4)</li>
<li>Collections</li>
<li>CSV</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Random</li>
<li>Requests</li>
<li>Regex</li>
<li>Selenium with Chrome Driver</li>
<li>Time</li>
</ul>

To run Chord_Scraping.py, you must set the location of your Selenium Chrome Driver as the PATH in line 12. You can also change the artist in line 10 to scrape chord progressions from other artists present in Hook Theory's Theory Tab. 

To run Chord_Analysis.py, you must specify the path of the CSV file with chord progression data, such as the one included in this repository. 

<h3>Some Examples</h3>

In its current state, the program outputs ten chord progressions in both a major and minor key in the style of The Beatles. Below is an example of this output.

There's a lot that goes into a Beatles-style song, and the chord progression is just one part of it. Many of their top songs (such as Hey Jude or Paperback Writer) feature simple, traditional pop chord progressions, while others (such as Martha My Dear) feature more 'interesting' and 'colorful' chords. I've found two to three chord progressions for every ten generated by this program work well and carry a stylistic influence of The Beatles.

From the output above, I found the [fourth major key chord progression](https://soundcloud.com/user-756588720/major-progression-example/s-Q9LKIETPRIf) and the [second minor key chord progression](https://soundcloud.com/user-756588720/minor-progression-example-2/s-gU94XnnMNIk) sound the best.
